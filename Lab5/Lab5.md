# EE160 Lab 5: More Functions and Loops

(Repo of lab notes: <https://github.com/duck8880/EE160>)

(Lab assignment: <http://www-ee.eng.hawaii.edu/~tep/EE160/Labs/Lab5/lab5.html>)

  ​

## Notes

- Eliminate all the warnings, or there will be deduction on your points. 

- Write your algorithms in the comments in your .c files

  ​

## Programs

- Create a new directory called **Lab5** in your **EE160/Labs** directory. Work in this directory.

- (2 Points). Complete the program, [sum.c](http://www-ee.eng.hawaii.edu/~tep/EE160/Labs/Lab5/sum.c), by translating the algorithm given there into C. 

  - __Input__: a set of numbers; __Output__: the sum of the numbers. 
  
  - You should terminate the input with the end-of-file character(`[Ctrl-D]`).
  
  example output:
  ```bash
  Enter a number: 10
  Enter a number: 20
  Enter a number: 30.5
  Enter a number: [Ctrl-D]
  The sum of the numbers is: 60.50
